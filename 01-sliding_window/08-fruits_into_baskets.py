# You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. The farm has following restrictions:

#     1. Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
#     2. You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
#     3. You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
