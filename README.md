# Grokking the Coding Interview
This follows the material from [*Grokking the Coding Interview*](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview). The course provides notes on given topics as well as small windows with python enviornments to run the examples. However, it can be useful to run in debugger mode. As such, I'm simply copying examples and solutions here so I can run them in my IDE and develop a better sense of their structure and pattern.


## Setup
1. set your virtual enviornement with `python venv .venv`
2. activcate your `.venv` with `.venv source/bin/activate`
3. install the requirements with `pip install requirements.txt`
